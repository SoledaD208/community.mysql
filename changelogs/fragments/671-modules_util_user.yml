bugfixes:
  - mysql_user,mysql_role - The sql_mode ANSI_QUOTES affects how the modules mysql_user
    and mysql_role compare the existing privileges with the configured privileges, 
    as well as decide whether double quotes or backticks should be used in the GRANT 
    statements. Pointing out in issue 671, the modules mysql_user and mysql_role allow
    users to enable/disable ANSI_QUOTES in session variable (within a DB session, the
    session variable always overwrites the global one). But due to the issue, the modules
    do not check for ANSI_MODE in the session variable, instead, they only check in the 
    GLOBAL one.That behavior is not only limiting the users' flexibility, but also not 
    allowing users to explicitly disable ANSI_MODE to work around such bugs like
